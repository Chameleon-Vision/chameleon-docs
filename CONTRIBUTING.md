# Contributing and formatting guidelines

## Language

This documentation is written in ReStructuredText and build (automaticly) with sphinx.

If you have no experience with the language you can read about it online or read our code and understand it.

To create a local build run `make html`

##	File Structure

Each page (a `.rst` file) should be in folder inside the `source` folder. For example `supported-hardware.rst` is under `hardware` folder in `source`.

## Naming Scheme

Each page file should be all lower case and `-` instead of space. For example `supported-hardware.rst`

Each word in a title should be capitilazed. For example `Supported Hardware`

## Images

All images and gifs should be under `source/images/` in a folder named after their use. For example `source/images/UI/homePage.PNG`
