Features

Filtering
^^^^^^^^^^^
Filter out your target from the background with HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) and then fine-tune using area, width, height, and ratio settings. Using advanced multi-target intersection filtering, you can filter even more.


Offset Calibration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
More often than not, it is not possible and/or inconvenient to place the camera in the center of the robot. Using special Chameleon Vision tools, it is easy to make a software fix for the physical offset from the true center.


Widespread Camera Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Chameleon Vision supports a large family of :ref:`USB cameras<supported-cameras>`. This allows you to get the most flexibility compared to other solutions. The Chameleon Vision Team recommends the PS3ye Camera (found on Amazon and other vendors) for maximum performance. 

.. note:: The Pi Camera and all network cameras are both NOT currently supported.


Easy Customization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Chameleon Vision can set resolution, FPS, brightness, and exposure for each USB camera that it has :ref:`detected<detected-cameras>`. It also publishes the camera view, which is divisible to save bandwidth. This customization allows you to ensure that Chameleon Vision works how you want it to.

Driver Mode Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Furthermore, cameras can be used as a driver's camera during a match through a setting called "Driver Mode", allowing you to take advantage of the software speed.
