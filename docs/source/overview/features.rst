Features
========

Filtering
^^^^^^^^^^^
Filter out your target from the background with HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) and then fine-tune using area, width, height, and ratio settings. Using advanced multi-target intersection filtering, you can filter even more.


Offset Calibration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Oftentimes, it is difficult to place the camera in the direct center of the robot.
Chameleon Vision contains special tools to fix the incorrect positioning.


Wide Range of Supported Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Chameleon Vision supports a wide range of both :ref:`coprocessors<supported-coprocessors>` and :ref:`cameras<supported-cameras>`.
This allows for the maximum amount of flexibility in both performance and cost.

For optimal performance, the Chameleon Vision Team recommends the Raspberry Pi 4 and the PS3Eye (available via online retailers).

.. warning::
    The Pi Camera Module and all Network Cameras are **NOT** yet supported.


Easy Customization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each camera connected to Chameleon Vision can have individual resolution, FPS, brightness, and exposure settings.
The camera views are visible from the Driver Station and can be sent at lower resolutions to conserve bandwidth.
This customization allows you to ensure that Chameleon Vision works how you want it to.

Driver Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cameras can also be configured to be passed to the Driver Station using the "Driver Mode" setting.
This allows the driver to take advantage of Chameleon Vision's speed in game.
