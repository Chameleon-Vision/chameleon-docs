Features
========

Filtering
^^^^^^^^^^^
Filter out your target from the background with HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) and then fine-tune using area, width, height, and ratio settings. Using advanced multi-target intersection filtering, you can filter even more.


Offset Calibration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Oftentimes, it is difficult to place the camera in the direct center of the robot.
Chameleon Vision contains special tools to fix the incorrect positioning.


Wide Range of Supported Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Chameleon Vision supports a wide range of both :ref:`coprocessors<supported-coprocessors>` and :ref:`cameras<supported-cameras>`.
This allows for the maximum amount of flexibility in both performance and cost.

For optimal performance, the Chameleon Vision Team recommends the Raspberry Pi 4 and the PS3Eye (available via online retailers).

.. warning::
    The Pi Camera Module and all Network Cameras are **NOT** yet supported.


Easy Customization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each camera connected to Chameleon Vision can have individual resolution, FPS, brightness, and exposure settings.
The camera views are visible from the Driver Station and can be sent a lower resolutions to conserve bandwidth.
This customization allows you to ensure that Chameleon Vision works how you want it to.

Driver Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cameras can also be configured to be passed to the Driver Station using the "Driver Mode" setting.
This allows the driver to take advantage of Chameleon Vision's speed in game.
