Command Line Information
===========================

When running Chameleon Vision a lot of information is displayed in the output of the terminal.
Most of this information is for debugging and is not needed.

.. note::
	Some of the output is not generated by Chameleon Vision but by external libraries.
	Please ignore these lines as well.


..  _webserver-port:
